# HTML5 Challenge 2

This is my solution to the [HTML5 Challenge 2](http://outofcomfortzone.net/2013/06/21/html5-challenge-2-web-socket/) as described by Frédéric Harper.  

This is a websockets based chat server and web client. WebSockets are implemented using [socket.io](http://socket.io/).
The backend is running on Node.js with socket.io.   

## Live Example running on Heroku
